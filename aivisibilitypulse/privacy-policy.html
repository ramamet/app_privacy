    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">AI Visibility Pulse by Multiscal &mdash; Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>AI Visibility Pulse ("the App") is developed by Multiscal. We respect your privacy. This policy explains what data the App accesses and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Specifically, we do not collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
        <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or crash reports</li>
        <li>Cookies or tracking data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the App Works</h2>
    <p>When you enter a URL and tap Analyze, the App makes HTTP requests directly from your device to the website you specified. It fetches the HTML content, robots.txt, and related files from that website to perform the analysis.</p>
    <p>All analysis is performed locally on your device. No website content or analysis results are sent to our servers.</p>

    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores your scan history on your device using local storage (SharedPreferences). This data never leaves your device and can be cleared by clearing the app data or uninstalling the App.</p>

    <h2>Network Requests</h2>
    <p>The App makes network requests only to the URLs you provide for analysis. These requests are made directly from your device to the target website. We do not route, proxy, or log these requests.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect personal data from anyone, including children under 13.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If we update this policy, we will revise the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@multiscal.com">info@multiscal.com</a>.</p>
